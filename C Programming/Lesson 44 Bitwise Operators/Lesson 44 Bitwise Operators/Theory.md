#  Bitwise Operators
The OR operator: it compares the bits of the individual columns to each
other. You look at the individual bits and you compare them.
Let's compare number 1 and 2.

00000001
00000010 | (OR)
--------
00000011

If either value has the value of 1, the result will be 1

The & (AND) operator demands that both numbers are 1 to result in an
output of 1 

00000001
00000010 & (AND)
--------
00000000
