/*!
 In Xcode 13 most of the Edit menu functionalities are not in the Editor menu
 Cmd-[ (Cmd-Opt-Ã¨) to outdent, Cmd-] (Cmd-Opt-+) to indent
 Find is not in the Find Navigator to the left
 Bookmarks seem gone
 Go to Line is now Jump to Line (Cmd-L) in the Navigate menu
 Cycle through the alternatives via Ctrl-period seems gone
 Ctrl-slash seems replaced by the Tab
 
 Edit All in Scope is in the Editor menu
 Insert Text Macro are now the Snippets Library (?)
